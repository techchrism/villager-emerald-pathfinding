# VillagerEmeraldPathfinding
Transporting villagers is a huge pain, and they have a tendency to go exactly where you don't want them to.
With this plugin, villagers will follow you if you're holding an emerald block in your hand or offhand.

**Note:**
This plugin is for Paper only. It will not work on plain Spigot.
